## Reason

The idea of applications ([Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg)) and games ([Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry)) having addons always fascinated me. The addition of features at runtime with one's own code, the modification of UI to one's own liking, and the ability to use others' plugins - sounds so awesome to me!

However, the existing Minecraft Launchers lack a user plugin system. While it is debatable whether extensible launchers for Minecraft are even needed, I still decided to make this project, primarily for myself.

## Demonstration

Screenshots of the launcher with or without user plugins.
