# MultiMC Patch System

The MultiMC patch system is a complex, yet convenient way to manage Minecraft launching with various mod loaders.

If one correctly integrates the patch system, they will be able to launch both Vanilla and Modded versions of Minecraft without ever reading any documentation for Minecraft mod loaders.

## TL;DR

![A schema that shows the installation and launching parts of Minecraft with MultiMC patch system](./assets/multimc-meta-schema.webp)

> Made in Paint.NET

`Other nested dependencies` represent the further dependency tree of patches.

Also, take into consideration RyRy's[^1] explanations:

- collect the json for a minecraft version from mojang's piston-meta -> transform it a bit for the one-six format
- stack patches on that data to build up a launch profile
- resolve components like lwjgl and log4j etc.
- fetch those libs from their respective maven urls
- if necessary, extract the natives for your platform
- if using a mod loader
  - collect loader metadata
    - resolve loader version for minecraft version
    - collect libraries for loader
    - (forge only) run processors to build the patched client
- build java class path with libs for client, loader, and all mods you want to load
- build java args from launch profile and any extra's the user wants
- actually launch Minecraft by combining all the above
  - prism and the multimc family use a launch wrapper to allow launch old applet bases versions and to simplify some things
    - other launchers use a direct java launch with an appropriate loader "main class" set.

## Prerequisites

Initially, I wanted to write the code parts as a pseudocode following the [CLRS conventions](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs3000/resources/latex_pseudocode.pdf). However, it would have taken plenty of time, so this walkthrough will only feature TypeScript. To make it easier for one to understand type schemas, they need to know:

- The `?` symbol represents an optional field, e.g. `{ "a"?: string }`.
- The `|` symbol represents a logical `XOR` (either of the types are present but not both).
- The `&` symbol represents a logical `AND` (both types are present).

Despite `|` and `&` being called 'Union' and 'Intersection' types, respectively, they do **not** represent the Set operators:

```ts
type First = { "a": number } | { "b": string };
// Implies:
// { "a": 10 };
// { "b": "Eden Treaty" };
//
// However, does not imply these:
// { "a": 10, "b": "Decagrammaton" };
// {};

type Second = { "a": number } & { "b": string };
// Implies:
// { "a": 0, "b": "Moondrop Aria" }; <-- both fields 'a' and 'b' are present
//
// However, does not imply these:
// { "a": 0 };
// { "b": "Sennheiser HD560S" };
// {};
```

- The `[key: KeyType]: value` field is a value with the computed key name of `KeyType`. For example, `{ [key: "macos" | "linux"]: string }` is equivalent to:

```ts
type T = {
  "macos": string;
  "linux": string;
}
```

The `Partial<{ ... }>` type represents an object where all fields are optional. That is, all fields could be missing. For example:

```ts
type Example = Partial<{ [key: "macos" | "linux"]: string }>;
// Implies:
// { "linux": "NixOS Yarara" };
// { "macos": "macOS Sequoia" };
// { "linux": "6.12.60", "macos": "15" };
// {};
```

## How to think of MultiMC patches

Before one starts the coding part, they should understand what to expect from patches.

As stated by Ryan[^2], the Prism Launcher meta server is generating JSON patches from multiple sources. These sources can have completely different library and asset structures. Bringing such format mismatches to one consistent response type is challenging. Thus, one will stumble upon many inconsistencies when handling MultiMC patches.

The MultiMC patch is a JSON file that represents the information needed to handle the current patch. The patch system aims to simplify the installation and launching parts of Minecraft. Each patch can specify dependency or conflicting patches (although the latter one seems to be rare). Dependencies are just another patches, so each dependency can have its own dependencies too.

It is possible that the correct way to navigate these patches is to:
 
- resolve the entry patch, patch dependencies, and all sub-dependencies;
- collect the resolved patches in the array;
- build the final patch, starting from sub-dependencies and ending with the entry patch.

Following the described way to navigate MultiMC patches, let us briefly understand how to apply this algorithm. For now, consider the version of a Minecraft patch to be `1.21.11` and the version of a Fabric loader patch to be `0.18.4`. The entry patch UID for Fabric is `net.fabricmc.fabric-loader`. It depends on a `net.fabricmc.intermediary` patch:

```json5
{
  // Other fields...
  "requires": [
    {
      "uid": "net.fabricmc.intermediary"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `net.fabricmc.intermediary` patch version should equal the Minecraft patch version. Thus, we can resolve the patch and obtain another array of dependencies:

```json5
{
  // Other fields...
  "requires": [
    {
      "equals": "1.21.11",
      "uid": "net.minecraft"
    }
  ]
}
```

This is a Minecraft patch. When we resolve it, we get another dependency:

```json5
{
  // Other fields...
  "requires": [
    {
      "suggests": "3.3.3",
      "uid": "org.lwjgl3"
    }
  ]
}
```

Luckily, the `org.lwjgl3` patch does not have any dependencies. Now, these resolved patches should be assembled into one final patch as was previously explained:

- Write the data from `org.lwjgl3:3.3.3` (dependency of `net.minecraft:1.21.11`) into an object.
- Overwrite the object using data from `net.minecraft:1.21.11` (dependency of `net.fabricmc.intermediary`).
- Overwrite the object using data from `net.fabricmc.intermediary` (dependency of `net.fabricmc.fabric-loader`).
- Overwrite the object using data from `net.fabricmc.fabric-loader` (entry patch).

The overwrite process follows next logic:

- In case of array-typed conflicting fields, merge them.
  - The merge process is not as simple as just pushing the element into an array. The next sections will explain it in details.
- In case of other types of conflicting fields, overwrite them.

The final patch can be used to download artifacts and launch the game. It may not have necessarily the MultiMC structure. One could implement their own format and parse all patches into that format.

For example, I implemented the final patch structure like this:

```ts
// You can just take a glance at the structure; inspecting it in details is unnecessary.
// There are still 8000 words left to read for you that explain everything :3
type FinalizedPatchType = {
  "+jvmArgs"          : Array<string>;
  "+traits"           : Array<string>;
  "+tweakers"         : Array<string>;
  "artifacts"         : Array<MappedArtifactType>;
  "mainClass"         : string;
  "minecraftArguments": string;
  "assetIndex"        : {
    "id"        : string;
    "sha1"      : string;
    "size"      : number;
    "url"       : string;
    "totalSize"?: number;
  } | undefined;
  "type"              : "release" | "snapshot" | "experiment" | "old_alpha" | "old_beta" | "old_snapshot" | undefined;
  "client"            : MappedArtifactType | false;
  "logging"           : (MappedArtifactType & {
    "argument": string;
  }) | false;
};
type MappedArtifactType = {
  "id"       : string;
  "path"     : string;
  "file"     : string;
  "directory": string;
  "url"      : string;
  // 'ignore' is used only when the hash is unknown
  "hash"     : string | "ignore";

  /**
   * 'library' should be both downloaded and included in classpath
   * 'mavenFile' should be downloaded
   * 'native' should be downloaded and extracted but not included in classpath
   */
  "status"?: "library" | "mavenFile" | "native";

  /*
   * Indicates the '+libraries' field in MultiMC patches.
   * Should be specified the first in classpath
   */
  "first"?: boolean;
};
```

This section is merely a short explanation, so I omitted the majority of important information. The actual final patch assemble is explained in the next sections.

## An in-depth structure of the MultiMC (Prism Launcher*) patch system

Since now one should have a surface-level understanding of the MultiMC patch system, they can dive deeper.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *The following sections will use Prism Launcher meta server, although the provided instructions should be applicable to MultiMC meta as well.

### Patch index files

> URL format: `https://meta.prismlauncher.org/v1/<uid>`

Now, let us start with the actual response types. This is a TypeScript type schema for the patch index files, the JSON files that contain available versions of the patch:

```ts
type PatchIndexType = {
  // Currently, equals to one
  "formatVersion": number;

  // A human-readable name of the patch
  "name": string;

  // A unique identifier of the patch. As of now, can be 12 different string literals
  "uid": PatchUIDType;

  // An array of available patches that are sorted from latest to oldest versions
  "versions": Array<PatchIndexVersionType>;
};
type PatchUIDType =
  "com.azul.java" |
  // LiteLoader patch
  "com.mumfrey.liteloader" |
  "net.adoptium.java" |
  // FabricMC patch
  "net.fabricmc.fabric-loader" |
  // A dependency of the FabricMC patch
  "net.fabricmc.intermediary" |
  // Vanilla Minecraft patch
  "net.minecraft" |
  "net.minecraft.java" |
  // Forge patch
  "net.minecraftforge" |
  // NeoForge patch
  "net.neoforged" |
  "org.lwjgl" |
  "org.lwjgl3" |
  // QuiltMC patch
  "org.quiltmc.quilt-loader";
```

The patch index type appears to always have this format.

The version entries have the next type schema:

```ts
type PatchIndexVersionType = {
  // Whether this version is a recommended one.
  // In the version select menu of Prism Launcher, star emojis represent this field
  "recommended": boolean;

  // The version release time in the ISO 8601 string format
  "releaseTime": string;

  // A SHA-256 hash that the provided JSON file for this patch version should have
  "sha256": string;

  // A version string, e.g. '26.1-snapshot-2' or '1.21.10'
  "version": string;

  // An array of conflicting patches
  "conflicts"?: Array<PatchDependencyType>;

  // An array of required patches, i.e. dependencies
  "requires" ?: Array<PatchDependencyType>;

  // Used not only in the 'net.minecraft' patches, but in others too
  "type"?: "release" | "snapshot" | "experiment" | "old_alpha" | "old_beta" | "old_snapshot";

  // No clue. Present in 'net.fabricmc.intermediary'
  "volatile"?: boolean;
};
```

Where `PatchDependencyType` looks like this:

```ts
type PatchDependencyType = {
  // A unique identifier of the dependency
  "uid": PatchUIDType;

  // A version of the dependency that should be selected
  "equals"?: string;

  // A version of the dependency that is recommended
  "suggests"?: string;
};
```

The patch index files are usually used on Minecraft instance creation. They are not needed in the installation and launching parts.

### Version-specific patches

> URL format: `https://meta.prismlauncher.org/v1/<uid>/<version>.json`

> [!WARNING]
> This is a beginning of absolute horrors of Minecraft installation and launching. It only gets worse from this point ^^
> 
> <img width="60%" src="./assets/never-kys-arisu.jpg" alt="A twitter post with Tendou Arisu plush and a 'never kys' text" />

The JSON files for version-specific patches diverse with each patch. This is what the final type looks like:

```ts
type SpecificPatchMetaType = {
  // Currently, equals to one
  "formatVersion": number;

  // A human-readable name of the patch
  "name": string;

  // The version release time in the ISO 8601 string format.
  // However, it should be noted that the release time could be missing in custom patches,
  // e.g. 'org.mcphackers.launchwrapper'
  "releaseTime": string;

  // A unique identifier of the patch. As of now, can be 12 different string literals
  "uid": PatchUIDType;

  // A version string, e.g. '26.1-snapshot-2' or '1.21.10'
  "version": string;

  /** All the next fields could be missing. */
  // Perhaps, these are Java agents.
  // Specified at https://github.com/PrismLauncher/meta/blob/main/meta/model/__init__.py#L342
  "+agents"?: Array<{ "argument"?: string }>;

  // Should be an array of needed libraries for this patch.
  // However, there is no way to surely tell the difference between the 'libraries' field
  // (besides looking at a Prism Launcher source code)
  "+libraries"?: Array<SpecificPatchLibraryType>;

  // This field contains a list of unique flags Prism Launcher uses when launching.
  //
  // So far, I have encountered next values:
  // - 'legacyLaunch'       // Appears to indicate the use of a legacy Java applet launcher in Prism
  // - 'XR:Initial'         // Present in versions with chat reports
  // - 'FirstThreadOnMacOS' // Tells to use the '-XstartOnFirstThread' JVM argument on macOS
  // - 'legacyServices'     // Old auth services (?)
  // - 'texturepacks'       // Shows that the version supports texture packs selection
  // - 'no-texturepacks'    // Shows that the version does not support texture packs selection
  //
  // There is also another format of traits, i.e. 'feature:*'.
  // They are usually present in newer versions. For now, there are only these options:
  // - 'feature:is_quick_play_singleplayer'
  // - 'feature:is_quick_play_multiplayer'
  //
  // Other possible values that I have not encountered:
  // - 'legacyFML'          // For old game versions
  // - 'alphaLaunch'        // Prism Launcher meta no longer has this value (?)
  // - 'noapplet'           // Prism Launcher meta no longer has this value (?)
  "+traits"?: Array<string>;

  // An array of tweak classes to pass to the game arguments.
  // For example, the ['com.mumfrey.liteloader.launch.LiteLoaderTweaker', 'another_tweaker']
  // will be passed as
  // '--tweakClass com.mumfrey.liteloader.launch.LiteLoaderTweaker --tweakClass another_tweaker'
  "+tweakers"?: Array<string>;

  // An array of JVM arguments to add.
  // So far, I have encountered next values:
  // - '-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true' // Present in ancient versions of Minecraft
  "+jvmArgs"?: Array<string>;

  // Seem to equal to the Mojang API response format.
  // Points to the Minecraft assets index JSON file
  "assetIndex"?: SpecificPatchAssetIndexType;

  // An array of Java major versions that are compatible with the patch
  "compatibleJavaMajors"?: Array<number>;

  // This field is present in '12w07b' and equals to 'jre-legacy' there
  "compatibleJavaName"?: string;

  // An array of conflicting patches. Usually present in 'org.lwjgl' and 'org.lwjgl3'
  "conflicts"?: Array<PatchDependencyType>;

  // An array of needed libraries for this patch.
  // Seems to be the most complex part of Minecraft launching
  "libraries"?: Array<SpecificPatchLibraryType>;

  // "The logging configuration file to provide to log4j" [2].
  // Stored in '/assets/log_configs/', alongside with '/assets/indexes/' and '/assets/objects/' [3]
  "logging"?: SpecificPatchLoggingType;

  // "The main class to call in the execution of java" [2]
  "mainClass"?: string;

  // Points to the Minecraft client jar
  "mainJar"?: SpecificPatchMainJarType;

  // An array of needed libraries for this patch that should be downloaded
  // without being specified in classpath.
  // However, if the library was also included in the 'libraries' field,
  // such library should be specified in classpath
  "mavenFiles"?: Array<SpecificPatchLibraryType>;

  // A string with the game arguments. These arguments have placeholders that should be replaced,
  // such as '--username ${auth_player_name}', where '${auth_player_name}' is the player name.
  //
  // Some placeholders might not be replaced, and Minecraft will still launch.
  // Others always require to be replaced. One such case is the '${user_properties}' placeholder
  // that has an unknown purpose, yet requires to be a stringified version of a JSON object with... random values?
  "minecraftArguments"?: string;

  // Deprecated. Used to help to sort patches, apparently
  "order"?: number;

  // An array of dependencies of this patch. As was shown with the Fabric example, can go three levels deep
  "requires"?: Array<PatchDependencyType>;

  // An array of runtimes to download. Used by Java patches, e.g. 'com.azul.java'
  // This field is not needed for Minecraft downloading and launching part,
  // so we will stop here
  "runtimes"?: Array<{ /* ... */ }>;

  // Used not only in the 'net.minecraft' patches, but in others too
  "type"?: "release" | "snapshot" | "experiment" | "old_alpha" | "old_beta" | "old_snapshot";

  // No clue. Present in 'net.fabricmc.intermediary'
  "volatile"?: boolean;
};
```

It should be noted that as per MultiMC documentation[^4], the `+agents`, `+traits`, `+tweakers`, and `+jvmArgs` should have their equivalent fields with the `-` sign or without the `+` sign. However, they seem to be [deprecated](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/blob/develop/launcher/minecraft/OneSixVersionFormat.cpp#L232).

The `SpecificPatchAssetIndexType` type schema is equal to:

```ts
type SpecificPatchAssetIndexType = {
  // Used for storing the index JSON file. Can be "27" or "pre-1.6"
  "id": string;

  // A SHA-1 hash that the downloaded JSON file should have
  "sha1": string;

  // The size of a JSON file in bytes
  "size": number;

  // Points to the assets index JSON file
  "url": string;

  // The total size of all asset objects in bytes
  "totalSize"?: number;
};
```

The `PatchDependencyType` type schema was defined previously, but let us see it again:

```ts
type PatchDependencyType = {
  // A unique identifier of the dependency
  "uid": PatchUIDType;

  // A version of the dependency that should be selected
  "equals"?: string;

  // A version of the dependency that is recommended
  "suggests"?: string;
};
```

The `SpecificPatchLoggingType` type schema is equal to:

```ts
type SpecificPatchLoggingType = {
  // A JVM argument that should be used (contains a placeholder to replace)
  "argument": string;

  // Turns out, the config file download format uses the same schema as the 'assetIndex' field
  "file": {
    // Used for storing the logging configuration JSON file
    "id": string;

    // A SHA-1 hash that the downloaded JSON file should have
    "sha1": string;

    // The size of a JSON file in bytes
    "size": number;

    // Points to the logging configuration JSON file
    "url": string;
  };

  // Usually equals to 'log4j2-xml'.
  // Perhaps, it could be used to parse Minecraft logs that are sent to console?
  // For example, old versions do not have the 'logging' field, thus their console output
  // is just raw lines of logs. But Minecraft versions that specify the 'logging' field
  // send to 'stdout' and 'stderr' the XML-formatted logs (due to '<XMLLayout />')
  // (if we use the configuration file provided in the 'logging' field, of course).
  "type": string;
};
```

The `SpecificPatchMainJarType` type schema is equal to:

```ts
type SpecificPatchMainJarType = {
  "downloads": {
    "artifact": {
      // A SHA-1 hash that the downloaded jar file should have
      "sha1": string;

      // The size of a jar file in bytes
      "size": number;

      // Points to the main jar downloads
      "url": string;
    };
  };
  // This is where it gets tricky (see explanations in the next section)
  "name": string;
};
```

Finally, the `SpecificPatchLibraryType` type schema is equal to:

```ts
type SpecificPatchLibraryType = {
  // Explained in the next section
  "name": string;
  // An object with all the information for downloading the library.
  // If it is missing, see a 'url' field
  "downloads"?: {
    // A library to download.
    // In newer versions, can represent a native library (1.21.2)
    "artifact"?: {
      // A SHA-1 hash that the downloaded file should have
      "sha1": string;
      // A file size in bytes
      "size": number;
      // A URL for downloading the library
      "url": string;
      // Cannot remember/find what this represents and where it was.
      // Just ignore it
      "id"?: string;
      // A relative filepath to where one should download a library.
      // Honestly, I have no idea if this field should even be used.
      // You will be able to obtain the same path value
      // in the next section ("Normalizing the artifact name")
      //
      // Example: 'net/neoforged/JarJarMetadata/0.4.1/JarJarMetadata-0.4.1.jar'
      "path"?: string;
    };
    // An additional native library to download for specified platforms (and arches).
    // Present in older versions (1.16.5)
    "classifiers"?: {
      // Same structure as in the 'artifact' field
      [key: SpecificPatchClassifierKeyType]: {
        "sha1": string;
        "size": number;
        "url": string;
        "id"?: string;
        "path"?: string;
      };
    };
  };
  // Seems like this field is not critical and can be ignored
  "extract"?: {
    // Directories to exclude extracting for.
    // For example, '["META-INF/"]' means not to extract the 'META-INF' folder for this native.
    "exclude": Array<string>;
  };
  // Seem to list available natives for present platforms and arches
  "natives"?: Partial<{
    // The 'linux' key turns into a 'natives-linux' value that
    // might have a 'SpecificPatchClassifierKeyType' type
    [key: SpecificPatchLibraryOSNameType]: string;
  }>;
  // A list of rules that should be applied for specified platforms (and arches)
  "rules"?: Array<SpecificPatchLibraryRuleType>;
  // A base URL for downloading this library.
  // Might be present only if the 'natives' and 'downloads' fields are missing.
  // Sometimes this field has a URL that ends with a slash, sometimes not
  "url"?: string;
  // What the heck is this (can be 'always-stale' or 'local')
  "MMC-hint"?: string;
};
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some libraries only specify the `name` field.
> In such case, use `https://libraries.minecraft.net` as a base URL for downloading that library.

The library object has some new types:

```ts
type SpecificPatchLibraryRuleType = {
  "action": "allow" | "disallow";
  "os"   ?: {
    "name": SpecificPatchLibraryOSNameType;
  };
};
type SpecificPatchLibraryOSNameType =
  // In this case, according to Scrumplex [5],
  // "...'linux', 'osx' and 'windows' are only matched on x86_64 or x86".

  // Linux x86_64 or x86
  "linux" |
  // Linux ARM32
  "linux-arm32" |
  // Linux ARM64
  "linux-arm64" |
  // Windows x86_64 or x86
  "windows" |
  // Windows ARM32
  "windows-arm32" |
  // Windows ARM64
  "windows-arm64" |
  // OSX x86_64 or x86
  "osx" |
  // OSX ARM64
  "osx-arm64" |
  // Linux ARM64
  "linux-riscv64";
type SpecificPatchClassifierKeyType =
  // It seems logical to consider 'natives-<platform>' as x86_64 and x86,
  // as the library OS names followed the same convention. However...
  "natives-linux" |
  "natives-linux-${arch}" |
  "natives-linux-arm32" |
  "natives-linux-arm64" |
  "natives-osx" |
  "natives-osx-${arch}" |
  "natives-osx-arm64" |
  "natives-windows" |
  "natives-windows-${arch}" |
  // ...'natives-<platform>' seem not to follow the same format
  "natives-windows-32" |
  // Huh? There is already 'natives-osx'...
  "natives-macos" |
  "natives-macos-${arch}" |
  "natives-macos-arm64" |

  /** The next literals are made up by me */
  // Encountered this value
  "natives-windows-64" |
  // Never saw these, but they might exist

### Normalizing the artifact name

The `name` field follows this format: `<group>:<name>:<version>[:classifier][@extension]`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `<name>` part can contain a `native` keyword. In such case, consider the `downloads` field to point to the native library download. Consequently, the `classifiers` field will be missing

Examples:

- `com.mojang:text2speech:1.11.3`
- `net.java.dev.jna:platform:3.4.0`
- `ca.weblite:java-objc-bridge:1.1.0-mmachina.1` - `<version>` can be in any format, not just SemVer
- `io.netty:netty-transport-native-epoll:4.1.97.Final:linux-aarch_64` - `[classifier]` is just a platform with an arch. Possible literals:
  - `"windows-aarch_64"`
  - `"windows-x86_64"`
  - `"linux-aarch_64"`
  - `"linux-x86_64"`
  - `"osx-aarch_64"`
  - `"osx-x86_64"`
- `net.neoforged:neoform:1.21.2-20241022.151510@zip` - `[classifier]` is missing, but `[extension]` is present. In this case, it equals to `zip`

The name string always has the `<group>`, `<name>`, and `<version>` parts. The `[classifier]` and `[extension]` parts are optional.

Parts are divided with a `:` symbol, except for `[extension]` - it is divided by the `@` symbol. The `<group>` part is divided by dots. The resulted array for `net.java.dev.jna` must look like this: `["net", "java", "dev", "jna"]`. The `[extension]` part should fall back to `jar` if missing.

For the coding part, I would suggest following next algorithm:

1. Split the string by `@` (let us call it `Array_1`).
2. The `[extension]` part will be a second element of an `Array_1` (fall back to `jar` if it is undefined).
3. Split the first element of `Array_1` by `:` (let us call it `Array_2`).
4. Take the `<group>`, `<name>`, `<version>`, and (if defined) `[classifier]` parts from `Array_2`, respectively.
5. A filename can look like this: `<name>-<version>[-classifier].[extension]`. If the classifier is undefined, it would look like this: `<name>-<version>.[extension]`. For example, the `com.mojang:text2speech:1.11.3` string will look like `text2speech-1.11.3.jar`.
6. For the file directory, split the `<group>` part by `.` (let us call it `Array_3`).
7. Push back the `<name>` and `<version>` parts into `Array_3`.
8. Join the `Array_3` elements using a path separator. For example, the `com.mojang:text2speech:1.11.3` string will look like `com/mojang/text2speech/1.11.3`.
9. Now you have an artifact classifier, filename, and directory. The relative filepath can be obtained by joining the file directory and filename.
10. **Important:** for the future process of parsing libraries, also make an `id` variable in a `<group>:<name>` format.

You can also look at the following code:

```ts
type SpecificPatchClassifierOSType =
  "windows-aarch_64" | "windows-x86_64" |
  "linux-aarch_64" | "linux-x86_64" |
  "osx-aarch_64" | "osx-x86_64";

function normalizeArtifactPath(artifact: string): {
  "directory" : string;
  "file"      : string;
  "classifier": SpecificPatchClassifierOSType | undefined;
  "id"        : string;
} {
  const prepared: Array<string> = artifact.split("@");
  const cleaned = prepared?.[0] ?? "";
  const extension = prepared?.[1] ?? "jar";
  const paths: Array<string> = cleaned.split(":");

  const group: string | undefined = paths?.[0];
  const name: string | undefined = paths?.[1];
  const version: string | undefined = paths?.[2];
  const classifier: string | undefined = paths?.[3];

  // The 'group', 'name', and 'version' elements should always be present
  if (!group || !name || !version) {
    const specifiedMessage: string =
      `(either group (${group}), name (${name}), or version (${version}) is missing)`;

    throw new Error(
      `Could not normalize artifact path ${specifiedMessage}`,
    );
  }

  const folders: Array<string> = [
    ...group.split("."),
    name,
    version,
  ];
  // You should use an appropriate path delimiter according to current OS
  const delimiter: string = "\\"; // For example, '/' or '\\'

  return {
    "directory": folders.join(delimiter),
    "file"     : classifier === undefined
      ? `${name}-${version}.${extension}`
      : `${name}-${version}-${classifier}.${extension}`,
    "classifier": classifier as SpecificPatchClassifierOSType | undefined,
    // 'org.ow2.asm:asm-tree'
    "id"        : `${group}:${name}`,
  };
}
```

### Rule parsing

```ts
type SpecificPatchLibraryRuleType = {
  "action": "allow" | "disallow";
  "os"   ?: {
    "name": SpecificPatchLibraryOSNameType;
  };
};
```

If there are no rules, include the library. Otherwise, start parsing them.

Lin[^3] suggests to start by disallowing the library.

One should include the library if the OS name is missing. If it is present, then they should allow the library if the specified platform and arch are compatible.

However, for NeoForge 1.21.1, this way of parsing rules additionally downloads 16 unused native libraries. This is a problem with meta itself (for backwards compatibility):

```json
{
  "name": "org.lwjgl:lwjgl-jemalloc-natives-windows-arm64:3.3.3",
  "rules": [
    {
      "action": "allow",
      "os": {
        "name": "windows"
      }
    },
    {
      "action": "allow",
      "os": {
        "name": "windows-arm64"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The specified rules allow this library to be downloaded on Windows x86_64, x86, and ARM64. Yet, by judging the library name, it is needed only for Windows ARM64. It also seems like Minecraft is working perfectly without it on Windows x86_64.

One might check the library name for `arm64` and `arm32` occurrences to approve the library only for the user arch. I am not sure if it will work in 100% cases, though.

The coding part.

```ts
let toInclude: boolean = false;

for (const rule of rules) { /* ... */ }
```

For each rule:

The OS name literal can be accessed via `rule.name.os` property. The action can be accessed via `rule.action`.

1. If the rule OS name is missing, overwrite `toInclude` to `true` if the action equals to `allow` and to `false` in other cases (`false`, undefined).
2. If the rule OS name is present, extract the platform and arch from it. `<platform>` (e.g. `linux` or `windows`) means `platform` and `x86_64` or `x86`[^5]. `<platform>[-arch]` means `platform` and `arm32` or `arm64` (depends on `[-arch]`), e.g. `linux-arm64` is equivalent to `linux` and `arm64`.
3. If the platform and arch are incompatible, do not overwrite `toInclude`.
4. If the platform and arch are compatible, then overwrite `toInclude` variable to `true` if the action equals to `allow` and to `false` in other cases (`false`, undefined).

> [!NOTE]
> The MultiMC meta server does not specify CPU architectures; they are exclusive to Prism Launcher meta[^5]

The TypeScript code representation of the algorithm:

```ts
function shouldIncludeLibrary({
  platform,
  arch,
  library,
}: {
  // The platform literals are decided by you
  "platform": "windows" | "linux" | "osx";

          "osx-arm64" |
          "osx";
      };
    }>;
  };
}): boolean {
  if (
    library?.rules === undefined ||
    !Array.isArray(library.rules)
  ) {
    return true;
  }

  let toInclude: boolean = false;

    const parsedOS: SpecificPatchLibraryOSNameType | undefined = rule?.os?.name;

    if (parsedOS === undefined) {
      toInclude = rule?.action === "allow";

      continue;
    }

    toInclude = handlePlatformRule({
      "rule": {
        "action": rule?.action ?? "allow",
        "os"    : {
          "name": parsedOS,
        },
      },
      "current": toInclude,
      platform,
      arch,
    });
  }

  return toInclude;
}

function handlePlatformRule({
  platform,

  current,
}: {

        "osx";
    };
  };
  "current": boolean;
}): boolean {
  const {

  const isCompatibleAnyArch: boolean = unifiedArch === "any" && (

  );
  const isCompatibleArch: boolean =
    isCompatibleAnyArch ||

  if (!isCompatiblePlatform || !isCompatibleArch) {
    return current;
  }

  return rule.action === "allow";
}
```

### Checking for natives

If the `classifiers` field is present, then the library **has** a native library (old format).

If the library name includes the `native` keyword, then the library **is** native (new format).

### Parsing the library and maven files

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Old-formatted native libraries are separate from "non-native" libraries. For this step, you should ignore them (the `classifiers` field).
> 
> New-formatted native libraries should be both added into classpath and extracted (the `artifact` field), so you need to parse them here too.
> 
> Do not forget about `+libraries` field. I only saw it in the OptiFine patch, though. By checking how Hello Minecraft! Launcher sorts classpath, it seems like `+libraries` should go before all other `libraries`

If the library only has a `name` field, then use `https://libraries.minecraft.net` as a base URL and build a download URL by normalizing `name` (`<group>:<name>:<version>[:classifier][@extension]`) into `<group splitted by dots and joined using a forward slash>/<name>/<version>/<name>-<version>[-classifier only if present].<extension>`, e.g. `net.minecraft:launchwrapper:1.12` becomes `https://libraries.minecraft.net/net/minecraft/launchwrapper/1.12/launchwrapper-1.12.jar`.

If the library only has the `name` and `url` fields, then use that `url` field as a base URL and build a download URL as described above.

If the library has the `downloads` field, then use `downloads.artifact.url` as a download URL.

### Parsing the native library

New-formatted native library formats specify the platform and arch in the `classifier` part of a library name (`<group>:<name>:<version>[:classifier][@extension]`). Extract the platform and arch from that classifier. If they are compatible, download the native library. You will need to extract it later.

Note that with new-formatted natives you already parsed them in the previous section, so you need to indicate that they are both downloaded, included in classpath, and extracted. Another possible solution is simply to leave them coexist in the same array of artifacts, and ignore artifact duplicates at downloading stages.

For example:

```ts
const entries: Array<{ "url": string; "path": string }> = [
  { "url": "https://...", "path": "..." },
];

const uniqueMap: Map<string, string> = new Map(
  // It is probably better to filter by unique paths rather than unique URLs...
  entries.map(({ url, path }) => [path, url]),
);
const uniqueArtifacts: Array<{ "url": string; "path": string }> = [];

for (const [path, url] of uniqueMap.entries()) {
  uniqueArtifacts.push({ url, path });
}
```

That way, we can filter out 70 duplicates out of 200 library artifacts for NeoForge 1.21.1.

If the native library has an old format, iterate over object entries in `classifiers`. If the iterated key has compatible platform and arch, use the `url` field in that classifier field as a download URL. The filename should probably be the same as the last part of a download URL. For example, in `https://libraries.minecraft.net/com/mojang/text2speech/1.11.3/text2speech-1.11.3-natives-linux.jar` the last part will be `text2speech-1.11.3-natives-linux.jar`. However, the name normalization algorithm that was defined earlier already follows the same naming convention (just need to add a `natives` suffix between `<version>` and `[classifier]`).

### Merging libraries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only for libraries. Maven files and native libraries should be ignored

Remember the patch hierarchy? Dependencies have lower priority than their "parent" patches. If the dependency specifies one version of a library, and the parent specifies another for that exact library, then the library specified by dependency should be ignored.

Consider NeoForge `21.2.1-beta` and Minecraft `1.21.2`. NeoForge patch specifies the next library:

```json
{
  "downloads": {
    "artifact": {
      "path": "org/ow2/asm/asm/9.7/asm-9.7.jar",
      "sha1": "073d7b3086e14beb604ced229c302feff6449723",
      "size": 125428,
      "url": "https://maven.neoforged.net/releases/org/ow2/asm/asm/9.7/asm-9.7.jar"
    }
  },
  "name": "org.ow2.asm:asm:9.7"
}
```

And Minecraft patch specifies this:

```json
{
  "downloads": {
    "artifact": {
      "sha1": "8e6300ef51c1d801a7ed62d07cd221aca3a90640",
      "size": 122176,
      "url": "https://libraries.minecraft.net/org/ow2/asm/asm/9.3/asm-9.3.jar"
    }
  },
  "name": "org.ow2.asm:asm:9.3"
}
```

If one includes both of these libraries in classpath, then the launching part will fail. That is why one needs to filter them.

Hash maps with library IDs (`<group>:<name>`) as keys should work. Each patch overwrites the map, and since patch parsing goes from dependencies to parents, the entry patches will always have the main priority.

### Finalizing the patch

As was previously said, final patch building should go from dependencies to parents. Array-typed fields are merged and other-typed fields are overwritten. Note that for arrays of strings it is sufficient to simply use sets since they are collections of distinct elements (strings in TypeScript are immutable primitives, by the way).

The TypeScript code representation of the patch finalizing algorithm:

```ts
function finalizePatches({
  patches,
}: {
  "patches": Array<SpecificPatchMetaType>;
}): FinalizedPatchType {
  // Initially, patches are sorted from parents to dependencies.
  // However, we need to go from dependencies to parents
  const reversed: Array<SpecificPatchMetaType> = patches.reverse();
  const foundMavenFiles: Array<MappedArtifactType> = [];
  // Patches might have overlapping artifacts with different versions
  const uniqueArtifacts = new Map<string, MappedArtifactType>;
  const built: FinalizedPatchType = {
    "+jvmArgs" : [],
    "+traits"  : [],
    "+tweakers": [],
    "artifacts": [],

    /*
     * Ancient versions do not specify the 'mainClass' field,
     * so use this class as a default value
     */
    "mainClass"         : "net.minecraft.client.Minecraft",
    "minecraftArguments": "",
    "assetIndex"        : undefined,
    "type"              : undefined,
    "client"            : false,
    "logging"           : false,
  };

  for (const patch of reversed) {
    if (patch?.["+jvmArgs"]) {
      // Duplicates will be removed at latter stages
      built["+jvmArgs"].push(...patch["+jvmArgs"]);
    }

    if (patch?.["+traits"]) {
      // Duplicates will be removed at latter stages
      built["+traits"].push(...patch["+traits"]);
    }

    if (patch?.["+tweakers"]) {
      // Duplicates will be removed at latter stages
      built["+tweakers"].push(...patch["+tweakers"]);
    }

    addMavenFiles( /* mavenFiles */ );
    addArtifactsToMap( /* libraries */ );
    addArtifactsToMap( /* +libraries */ );

    if (patch.mainClass) {
      built.mainClass = patch.mainClass;
    }

    if (patch.minecraftArguments) {
      built.minecraftArguments = patch.minecraftArguments;
    }

    if (patch.assetIndex) {
      built.assetIndex = patch.assetIndex;
    }

    if (patch.type) {
      built.type = patch.type;
    }

    // 'parseLogging' simply converts the 'logging' field into a 'MappedArtifactType' object
    const currentLogging = parseLogging({ patch });
    // 'parseMainJar' simply converts the 'mainJar' field into a 'MappedArtifactType' object
    const currentClient = parseMainJar({ patch });

    // Overwrite the 'logging' field only if the parsed data is defined
    if (currentLogging) {
      built.logging = currentLogging;
    }

    // Overwrite the 'client' field only if the parsed data is defined
    if (currentClient) {
      built.client = currentClient;
    }
  }

  built.artifacts = [
    ...foundMavenFiles,
    ...uniqueArtifacts.values(),
  ];

  return built;
}
```

## Downloading objects

For some reason, most of Minecraft launchers do not download libraries, assets, client, and logging configuration concurrently. They do it sequentially, even though the assets and libraries themselves are downloaded concurrently. I would suggest to use concurrent resolving of concurrent downloading steps (alright, what am I talking about at this point). Assets, Minecraft client, logging configuration, and libraries do not depend on each other, so one can safely handle all of them at the same time.

```ts
const responses: Array< /* response types */ > = await Promise.all([
  Fetching.downloadAssets({ finalizedPatch }),
  Fetching.downloadClient({ finalizedPatch }),
  Fetching.downloadLogging({ finalizedPatch }),
  Fetching.downloadLibraries({ finalizedPatch }),
]);
```

### Assets

The asset indexes should be stored in `assets/indexes`, the asset objects should be stored in `assets/objects`[^3]. They are shared across all instances.

```ts
type SpecificPatchAssetIndexType = {
  // Used for storing the index JSON file. Can be "27" or "pre-1.6"
  "id": string;

  // A SHA-1 hash that the downloaded JSON file should have
  "sha1": string;

  // The size of a JSON file in bytes
  "size": number;

  // Points to the assets index JSON file
  "url": string;

  // The total size of all asset objects in bytes
  "totalSize"?: number;
};
```

The asset index file should use `id` and look like `<id>.json`, e.g. `27.json`. It contains an object will all asset objects to download:

```json5
{
  "objects": {
    "icons/icon_128x128.png": {
      "hash": "b62ca8ec10d07e6bf5ac8dae0c8c1d2e6a1e3356",
      "size": 9101
    },
    // Other objects...
  }
}
```

The object key can be ignored. What one actually needs here is `hash`:

1. Use `https://resources.download.minecraft.net/` as a base URL.
2. Get first two characters of the hash.
3. Append it to the base URL (e.g. `https://resources.download.minecraft.net/b6`).
4. Append the full hash to the URL (e.g. `https://resources.download.minecraft.net/b6/b62ca8ec10d07e6bf5ac8dae0c8c1d2e6a1e3356`).

These URLs should be downloaded into `<asset objects directory>/<first two chars>` as `<full hash>`. Asset objects do not have any file extensions. For example, `assets/objects/b6/b62ca8ec10d07e6bf5ac8dae0c8c1d2e6a1e3356`.

Before downloading, check for the existence of all resulted file paths and verify their SHA-1 hashes. Download the missing ones.

> [!NOTE]
> There are exactly 256 possible unique combinations of short hashes, i.e. hexadecimals.

### Artifacts (libraries, natives, and mavenFiles)

These artifacts are shared across all instances.

Use the normalized artifact names for relative paths (e.g. `org/lwjgl/lwjgl/3.3.3/lwjgl-3.3.3.jar`) and join them with your libraries folder directory.

Verify these paths, just like you did it with asset objects, then you should download missing ones.

### Logging configuration

Logging configurations are shared across all instances.

Let us remember the logging configuration structure:

```ts
type SpecificPatchLoggingType = {
  // A JVM argument that should be used (contains a placeholder to replace)
  "argument": string;

  // Turns out, the config file download format uses the same schema as the 'assetIndex' field
  "file": {
    // Used for storing the logging configuration JSON file
    "id": string;

    // A SHA-1 hash that the downloaded JSON file should have
    "sha1": string;

    // The size of a JSON file in bytes
    "size": number;

    // Points to the logging configuration JSON file
    "url": string;
  };

  // Usually equals to 'log4j2-xml'.
  // Perhaps, it could be used to parse Minecraft logs that are sent to console?
  // For example, old versions do not have the 'logging' field, thus their console output
  // is just raw lines of logs. But Minecraft versions that specify the 'logging' field
  // send to 'stdout' and 'stderr' the XML-formatted logs (due to '<XMLLayout />')
  // (if we use the configuration file provided in the 'logging' field, of course).
  "type": string;
};
```

The `file.id` property is a filename with extension, e.g. `client-1.12.xml`. Simply download the file from `file.url` and save it using `file.id` as a name in the logging configuration directory.

### Client (main jar)

Client jars are shared across all instances.

The Minecraft client download structure is already familiar to you:

```ts
type SpecificPatchMainJarType = {
  "downloads": {
    "artifact": {
      // A SHA-1 hash that the downloaded jar file should have
      "sha1": string;

      // The size of a jar file in bytes
      "size": number;

      // Points to the main jar downloads
      "url": string;
    };
  };
  // Normalize it once again
  "name": string;
};
```

## Launching the Minecraft

The launching command looks like this: `<java binary> <JVM arguments> <classpath> <main class> <game arguments>`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Depending on your programming language and used libraries to spawn programs, you probably want to provide arguments as an array of strings. Otherwise, you might see `Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine`.
> 
> If you have decided to provide launch arguments as an array of strings, then the elements of that array should approximately look like this:
> 
> ```ts
> const commandArguments: Array<string> = [
>   "-XX:HeapDumpPath=MojangTricksIntelDriversForPerformance_javaw.exe_minecraft.exe.heapdump",
>   "-XstartOnFirstThread",
>   "-Dminecraft.launcher.brand=A Launcher", // yes, without wrapping the value or a whole argument into double quotes
>   "-cp",
>   "C:\\...;...\\client.jar", // classpath
>   "net.minecraft.client.Minecraft",
>   "--gameDir",
>   "C:\\...\\minecraft",
>   "--assetsDir",
>   "C:\\...\\assets",
>   "--versionType",
>   "Kaede 0.0.0", // versionType is not used anywhere, so we can pass any value into it
>   "--tweakClass",
>   "net.minecraft.launchwrapper.AlphaVanillaTweaker",
> ];
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> Oh, you are finally here. You made a great progress!

### Extracting the natives

These are **not** shared across all instances.

According to Ryan[^2], "natives are binaries such as dynamic libraries and DLLs that are specific for each platform".

They represent `.jar` files.

Jar files are essentially archive files. You need to extract the files from them into instance-specific `natives` folder. This process is done on every instance launch[^3].

Some libraries (e.g. LWJGL and `java-objc-bridge`) require to use platform-specific bindings, so the natives extraction step is important[^2].

### Java binary

You can use `java` or an absolute path to the java binary: `C:\\Program Files\\Eclipse Adoptium\\jdk-8.0.472.8-hotspot\\bin\\java.exe`.

On Windows, you might want to use `javaw` (or `javaw.exe` in paths) if Java spawns a command line window.

### Java Virtual Machine arguments

It seems like one can specify JVM arguments that were not targeted for current Minecraft version, and the game will still work as intended. This implies, for example, that FML-specific JVM arguments can be present even in Vanilla versions.

The list of possible JVM arguments includes but is not limited to:

- `-Xms<number><m or g>` - the minimum heap memory in megabytes/gigabytes that is allocated to the Java process, e.g. `-Xms4g` or `-Xms4096m`.
- `-Xmx<number><m or g>` - the maximum heap memory in megabytes/gigabytes that is allocated to the Java process, e.g. `-Xmx6144m`.

> [!NOTE]
> Heap is a dynamic memory area in RAM. Java is an interpreted (excluding GraalVM Native Image subsets of Java) language by nature, so (almost) all code objects are stored in the heap memory.

- `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` - prevents Log4Shell, although this argument is probably not needed anymore since that issue should have been fixed in libraries by this point. It also does not work for some old Minecraft versions.
- `-Djava.net.useSystemProxiestrue` - Hello Minecraft! Launcher by default includes this argument. No clue why it lacks the `=` sign before `true` (still works, though).
- `-Dfml.ignoreInvalidMinecraftCertificates=true` - [Hello Minecraft! Launcher by default includes this argument](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL/blob/5c2bb1cc251901dd471a8aa8048d90c22bb56916/HMCLCore/src/main/java/org/jackhuang/hmcl/launch/DefaultLauncher.java#L263).
- `-Dfml.ignorePatchDiscrepancies=true` - [Hello Minecraft! Launcher by default includes this argument](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL/blob/5c2bb1cc251901dd471a8aa8048d90c22bb56916/HMCLCore/src/main/java/org/jackhuang/hmcl/launch/DefaultLauncher.java#L264).
- `-DlibraryDirectory=${libraries_directory}` - is used by some old versions of Minecraft. Points to libraries directory.
- `-Djava.library.path=${natives_directory}` - points to a temporary natives directory.
- `-Dminecraft.client.jar=${main_jar_path}` - Hello Minecraft! Launcher *sometimes* includes this argument. Points to the client jar path.
- `-Djna.tmpdir=${natives_directory}` - points to a temporary natives directory.
- `-Dorg.lwjgl.system.SharedLibraryExtractPath=${natives_directory}` - points to a temporary natives directory.
- `-Dio.netty.native.workdir=${natives_directory}` - points to a temporary natives directory.
- `-Dminecraft.launcher.brand=${launcher_name}` - represents your Launcher name.
- `-Dminecraft.launcher.version=${launcher_version}` - represents your Launcher version.
- `-Duser.language=${user_locale}` - user locale. For example, `-Duser.language=en`.

Windows-specific ones:

- `-Dos.name=Windows 10` - only on Windows 10. No idea what it does.
- `-Dos.version=10.0` - only on Windows 10. No idea what it does.
- `-XX:HeapDumpPath=MojangTricksIntelDriversForPerformance_javaw.exe_minecraft.exe.heapdump` - appears to improve the game performance for Intel CPUs but also [causes problems for some users](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/issues/5477).

MacOS-specific ones:

- `-XstartOnFirstThread` - appears to improve the game performance. Should be included if the `+traits` (or `traits`) field has a `XstartOnFirstThread` value.

For performance tweaking, see [Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks repository](https://github.com/brucethemoose/Minecraft-Performance-Flags-Benchmarks).

### Classpath

Lin[^3] states that "the classpath is a string that includes all the paths to the libraries and the path to the game client itself".

The order of libraries in the Java classpath matters. To build it like in Hello Minecraft! Launcher, add the parsed libraries from `+libraries` first, then from the `libraries` field, and end with a path to the client jar.

> Hello Minecraft! Launcher this, Hello Minecraft! Launcher that... Wasn't this a guide for launching Minecraft using a MultiMC patch system?
> 
> Hello Minecraft! Launcher directly launches Minecraft since it is a Java program, so the launch command is easily accessible. Prism Launcher uses Java applets to manage Minecraft launching because it is not a Java program, so that seems to be a reason why I cannot get the exact launch command for Prism.

The libraries should be separated by a `:` symbol on Linux and macOS. On Windows, the `;` symbol should be used.

Also, include `-cp` before classpath.

An example for a vanilla version of Minecraft 1.0 on Windows 10:

```
-cp C:\Users\windstone\AppData\Roaming\kaede\libraries\net\java\jinput\jinput\2.0.5\jinput-2.0.5.jar;C:\Users\windstone\AppData\Roaming\kaede\libraries\net\java\jutils\jutils\1.0.0\jutils-1.0.0.jar;C:\Users\windstone\AppData\Roaming\kaede\libraries\org\lwjgl\lwjgl\lwjgl-platform\2.9.4-nightly-20150209\lwjgl-platform-2.9.4-nightly-20150209.jar;C:\Users\windstone\AppData\Roaming\kaede\libraries\org\lwjgl\lwjgl\lwjgl\2.9.4-nightly-20150209\lwjgl-2.9.4-nightly-20150209.jar;C:\Users\windstone\AppData\Roaming\kaede\libraries\org\lwjgl\lwjgl\lwjgl_util\2.9.4-nightly-20150209\lwjgl_util-2.9.4-nightly-20150209.jar;C:\Users\windstone\AppData\Roaming\kaede\libraries\com\mojang\minecraft\1.0\minecraft-1.0-client.jar
```

### Main class

As was previously said, sometimes Minecraft patches will not specify a main class. For example, the `a1.1.2_01` version does not specify a main class. In such cases, fall back to `net.minecraft.client.Minecraft`. Most of the time it will be a correct class name.

Note that there exists some strange class names, like `ax` in `a1.0.4`. They are valid, although I could not manage to launch that version without using a [custom LaunchWrapper](https://github.com/MCPHackers/LaunchWrapper).

### Game arguments

The provided by Prism Launcher meta Minecraft arguments are sufficient to launch the game. However, one can add the `--height` and `--width` arguments with specified integer values to configure the Minecraft window size, e.g. `--height 600 --width 800`.

The most important part here is not to forget to add tweaker classes (if `+tweakers` are present): `--tweakClass <tweak class>` (for each tweak class). Some versions (`a1.0.4`) may already include it in `minecraftArguments`.

### Replacing placeholders

> [!NOTE]
> You are almost there...

> <img width="60%" src="./assets/never-kys-aru.jpg" alt="A twitter post with Rikuhachima Aru plush and a 'never kys' text" />

These placeholders are seen in JVM arguments and game arguments. The `classpath` substitution is made in `-cp ${classpath}`. You may directly write `-cp <classpath string>` without ever using a `${classpath}` placeholder.

The list of placeholders that are not related to authentication:

- `assets_index_name` - the assets index id, e.g. `27` or `pre-1.6`.
- `assets_root` - the directory of the game assets, e.g. `assets` (not `objects`, `indexes`, or `log_configs`).
- `game_assets` - the directory of the game assets, e.g. `assets` (not `objects`, `indexes`, or `log_configs`).
- `classpath` - the built classpath string.
- `game_directory` - the directory of instance-specific `minecraft` folder.
- `launcher_name` - represents your Launcher name.
- `launcher_version` - represents your Launcher version.
- `natives_directory` - "the directory of the platform natives"[^2].
- `quickPlayMultiplayer` - "the host of the multiplayer server"[^3].
- `quickPlayPath` - "where to output the logs files, relative to .minecraft"[^3] (`.minecraft` can be just `minecraft`).
- `quickPlayRealms` - "the ID of the Minecraft Realms"[^3].
- `quickPlaySingleplayer` - "the path to the singleplayer world"[^3].
- `resolution_height` - "user's specified custom resolution height"[^3].
- `resolution_width` - "user's specified custom resolution width"[^3].
- `user_properties` - no idea. Used by old versions. Can be set to `"{ \"unknown\": [\"unknown\"] }"`.
- `user_type` - possible values are: `msa`, `mojang`, and `offline`.
- `version_name` - the Minecraft version.
- `version_type` - should be a Minecraft version type (e.g. `release` or `snapshot`), yet this value is not used anywhere except as a display text on the home screen. Hello Minecraft! Launcher puts its own name there.
- `libraries_directory` - used for the `-DlibraryDirectory=` JVM argument. Points to libraries directory.
- `main_jar_path` - used for the `-Dminecraft.client.jar=` JVM argument. Points to the client jar path.

The list of auth placeholders:

- `auth_access_token` - "the account's Minecraft access token, required for accessing servers with online-mode and Minecraft Realms"[^3].
- `auth_player_name` - "the username of the player"[^2].
- `auth_session` - Account's session ID. Used in old version, e.g. 1.6.4.
- `auth_uuid` - "the authentication UUID provided by MSA"[^2].
- `auth_xuid` - "the account's XUID, only present in newer versions with Microsoft integration"[^3].
- `clientid` - "base64 encoded uuid from clientId.txt in .minecraft"[^6]. Present in newer versions.

### Spawning a Minecraft process

Besides correctly passing launch arguments and using a Java binary as the process program, you also need to set a working directory to the instance directory (`minecraft` one).

The 1.5.2 and older versions do not support specifying the game directory. On Windows, they use `%appdata%/.minecraft`. Use [a custom LaunchWrapper](https://github.com/MCPHackers/LaunchWrapper) to fix this issue. These versions can also fail to launch if `options.txt` and `optionsof.txt` in `%appdata%/.minecraft` are not their cup of tea (I honestly do not know what the reason can be. Just delete these files or use a custom LaunchWrapper).

Now is the moment of truth: launch the game!

### Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine

Your launch arguments are invalid.

### Multiplayer does not work

I have the same issue :c

No idea why it does not work.

### a1.0.4

```
Error: Main method not found in class ax, please define the main method as:
   public static void main(String[] args)
or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
```

Use [a custom LaunchWrapper](https://github.com/MCPHackers/LaunchWrapper) for ancient versions.

# Unknown information

- What are Java agents
- What to do if the patch has specified multiple dependencies at once (are there any such cases tho)
